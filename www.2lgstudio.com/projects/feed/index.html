		<description><![CDATA[This victorian property was brought to life by us with the use of playful colours and classic materials - perfect for the vibrant young couple who call it home. ]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A double-fronted period property in South London that was in need of a personality injection to make it feel like home. The young professional newly-weds who live here love our use of colour and the juxtaposition of period features and contemporary design.</p>
<p>Dark floors unite the spaces, grounding them and allowing us to be playful in our designs for this vibrant couple.</p>
<p>Embossed wallpaper on the ceilings and under the dado rail in the hallway, strengthen the impact of period fireplace and coving, giving the perfect backdrop for eclectic elements of contemporary design in the lighting and furnishings.</p>
<p>This is an ongoing project with an extension, loft conversion and master suite yet to be completed. Watch this space for more updates.</p>

		<description><![CDATA["An evolving interior, a place to spread our wings, our muse, our studio, our canvas, our home” Jordan and Russell]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Each element has been inspired by found objects and prints from within the house as well as our own design travels. Its previous owners clearly had a passion for interiors as it had pink walls throughout, and deep green carpets. In the loft we found a stash of old interior magazines from the 50&#8217;s and 60&#8217;s as well as remnants of fabrics.</p>
<p>The garden, with its central apple tree, old english roses and camelia tree, also has a major impact on the way we are designing the spaces. Inspiring the colour palette and floral motifs.</p>
<p>As the house evolves with us, it has been through many stages, acting not only as a home, but as a backdrop for our work as designers. So far we have restored the roof and chimneys, the original sash windows and floors. We have completed the pink bathroom, updated the front door, given ourselves a wonder closet for a WC, created an entrance hallway the previous owners would have loved, we hope, and given the lounge added panelling to go with the original coving and ceiling rose, based on pencil markings we found on the walls under the old wallpaper. The open plan kitchen/diner/studio space is the heart of the project and was the inspiration behind many new product designs.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[An edwardian cottage renovation with rear and loft extension, inspired by global travel, with salvaged materials, bespoke finishes and bold colour. ]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As seen in Domino Magazine</p>
<p>An edwardian cottage in the charming setting of St Albans in need of modernisation. We re-designed the entire property, added a large kitchen extension, first floor extension and loft, doubling the size of the property to make a characterful family home.</p>
<p>The home has 5 bedrooms, 3 bathrooms, open plan kitchen/diner/living area, playroom, utility/office space and landscaped gardens.</p>
<p>The clients passion for travel, the sea and surfing, is evident throughout with many items sourced from salvage yards and antique shops in Sri Lanka. The striking blue pillars are a great example. Throughout the property we specified bespoke encaustic tiling, patterned carpet, exposed plaster, floral wallpaper and vintage lighting to give a lived in, eclectic home that reflects the warmth of the family. In the kitchen, custom cement island in pale blue and grey swirls compliments the solid wood worktops and impressive range cooker.</p>
<p>This happy home has a through-line of  bold colour that brings it life, something that is a signature of our design work.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A complete redesign and renovation of this one bed London apartment, creating a new start for the homeowner. A layered scheme of pale wood, natural stone and linen with touches of brass and laquered wood. The palette is a soft neutral base (perfect for our client) with a powerful deep burgundy top note that adds sensuality. Bespoke joinery creates ample storage with black metal details throughout that ground the whole space. We opened up all the doorways to full ceiling height and connected the kitchen to the space with a new opening.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Originally 3 flats, now with 5 generous bedrooms and 3 en-suite bathrooms. It&#8217;s packed full of clever storage solutions and exciting new materials with eco credentials like the bespoke recycled plastic dining table.</span></p>
<p><span class="s1">Connecting the bright, gallery like spaces, we created a moment of compression at the entrance to the main living space with a richly coloured, curved ceiling tunnel. The bespoke geometric fabric draws you though the &#8216;tunnel&#8217;, creating a focal point and seat within the built in shelving that connects the living and dining spaces.</span></p>
<p><span class="s2">Our geometric design for the engineered wooden flooring, with brass trim detail, gives an unexpected twist underfoot. </span><span class="s1">We commissioned wall murals to give a through line of colour, leading up to an explosion of fun for the children&#8217;s rooms in the loft conversion.</span></p>

		<description><![CDATA[Our contemporary take on an 80’s interior, designing this stunning brutalist apartment in St John’s Wood was pure pleasure.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">With its original teak &#8216;floor to ceiling&#8217; double doors, textured concrete ceilings and large wrap around windows, we could see the potential of this interior immediately. The bespoke upholstery, cutting edge wallpaper and restored vintage lighting make this one luxury city pad that is full of charisma.</span></p>
<p><span class="s1">The colour scheme was inspired by a trip to Milan Design Festival and cult 80s tv show, Dynasty – perfectly suiting the period of this apartment.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The challenge was to take this shell of a victorian townhouse and make it in to a modern space that reflected the different styles of the lovely couple who live here. The colour palette modulates, creating different atmospheres &#8211; It’s a fine balance of total opulence and honest raw materials like concrete, brass and corten steel. Statement lighting combines with vintage pieces and bespoke furniture to create a dramatic curated feel. </span><span class="s2">We particularly loved designing custom joinery for several of the spaces giving our client a truly unique home. There is a flow throughout the property, with a touch of drama in each space.</span></p>

		<description><![CDATA[Arts &#038; Crafts for a modern family. This house was love at first sight and we wanted to maintain the strong heritage of the architecture, whilst bringing it up to date with our interior design.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A 5 bed Arts &amp; Crafts home given our modern twist with contemporary craft and bespoke elements. This impressive family home, in the beautiful countryside setting of Farnham, has its own orchard, rose walk and tree house. It was love at first sight and we wanted to maintain the strong heritage of the architecture, whilst bringing it up to date with our new take. We asked ourselves, if William Morris were alive today, who might he work with and what patterns might he create, to bring this home to life.</p>
<p>We created a bespoke colourway of our floral, handprinted, wallpaper (designed in collaboration with Custhom) and our hand knotted rug for FloorStory. Giving a through-line on the ground floor &#8211; our personal take on the nature inspired prints of William Morris. Much of the original oak panelling, doors and pillars is left lovingly exposed, with the rest of the home given a neutral base to let the artworks and antique pieces shine.</p>
<p>A bespoke brass and oak dining table, commissioned by us from british design brand, Novocastrian, with contemporary chairs by Ercol, becomes the centrepiece of the home. The Liberty of London upholstery on the banquet seating giving another nod to the cultural heritage of the property. The lighting in the hallway, and throughout in brass and black metal, has a leaf motif that is entirely appropriate for the Arts &amp; Crafts movement, yet adds a modern wit.  The craftsmanship in the lighting of Pinch, seen in the sitting room and music room, creates a strong story of craft to be handed down through generations, without ever being taken too seriously.</p>
<p>Bespoke encaustic tiles sit beautifully with the original deep green glazed tiles of the fireplace in the music room and follow through into the family and master bathroom. Leading up to an attic space that is part playroom, part movie room &#8211; a space for all the family to relax.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Bringing together fine handcrafted British silks with touches of leather, marble and glass for a fresh luxe interior. We introduced a mirror wall in the open plan kitchen diner to maximise impact and took the master suite from the basement to the airy first floor with roof terrace. The colour scheme of mint green with a monochromatic base and touches of gold has a freshness with just the right amount of luxury. The star piece in this scheme is the wallpaper artwork that we shipped over from Brooklyn especially for our client. To compliment this we had her collection of old family photographs turned into beautiful icons in their own right with bespoke framing. Clean lines, luxurious textures and decorative beauty make this home special.</span></p>
