		<description><![CDATA[World class craftsmanship meets cutting edge composite waste and recycled materials with a knife set and boards that are top class and full of impact. Useful and delightful.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A collection for your kitchen, designed and handmade in collaboration with Savernake, the progressive knifemakers.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.savernakeknives.co.uk/product-category/special-editions/"><strong>Available to order here.</strong></a></p>
<p>Savernake believe in openness and getting their incredibly crafted pieces into the hands of every passionate cook they can. We loved their bravery and open approach so the design process has been incredible.</p>
<p>Our design combines bold shapes with strong colour and material choices. The combinations of materials are beautiful and functional, with recycled plastic, post-industrial composite waste and compressed paper making the knife handles, display boards and chopping surfaces in this collection of 3 knives and 3 boards.</p>
<p>They can be wall mounted with a hook to hold the boards when not in use and a magnetic strip to safely store the knives, giving a great display in your kitchen at the same time.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The classic Ercol Loveseat, hand crafted in Ercol&#8217;s UK factory from solid steam bent Ash and Oak, re-imagined by 2LG for Pride.</p>
<p>Equality is so close to our hearts, and so we took the base idea of the rainbow and gave it our own contemporary take, pastels and electric blue and neon yellow. As if the love seat had been to the party and come back covered in the bold colours of pride itself.</p>
<p>All of the colours blend together where they meet and we designed individual colour treatments with specific proportions and positions, so that each piece is unique, showcasing the skill of the master sprayer at the Ercol factory. No two will be the same, but they will each feature all of the 7 colours that make up our 2LG rainbow.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Featured in Wrap Magazine and on Sight Unseen</p>
<p>Designed in collaboration with jesmonite artist, Olivia Aspinal, this dining table is a showpiece.</p>
<p>We wanted to create a piece that would pull together the elements of our Kitchen renovation, combining green and pink in a pill shaped table on pillar legs, made entirely from concrete and resin in the UK at Olivia Aspinal&#8217;s studio.</p>
<p>The name comes from the film make, Stanley Kubrick, who inspired us to disrupt the norm with this piece.</p>
<p>Each marbled slab is individually made and contains polished brass within the marbling. They are then laid in the mould and cast into the table top. It is available now to order and we welcome any bespoke commissions for the surface design we created with Olivia for other projects.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Featured in Living Etc and House &amp; Garden magazine</p>
<p>This 4 piece collection for Love Your Home features the Tilda sofa and armchair and the Luca Bed and Storage ottoman.</p>
<p>The Tilda sofa was named after our favourite actress, Tilda Swinton, and was inspired by a trip to visit the setting of her movie, I Am Love, Villa Necchi in Milan. There we saw a large curved sofa and it left a huge impression on us. This is our contemporary riff on that sofa and is designed with two high backed corners. perfect for putting your feet up and resting on lazy sunday, but still elegant enough to keep your living space looking beautiful.</p>
<p>The Luca bed, named after Italian director, Luca Guadagnino, with its accompanying pill shaped ottoman, is a modern arched bed with curved detailing on the base and legs.</p>
<p>We designed this collection over an 18 month period and have curated a selection of fabrics in linen and cotton velvet to go with the collection. It is made in the UK.</p>
<p>Available to order now from <a href="https://www.love-your-home.co.uk/view-the-2lg-collection"><strong>Love Your Home</strong></a></p>
