				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Every April, for the past 6 years, we have been making an annual design pilgrimage to Milan for Salone Del Mobile, one of our favourite and most enriching weeks of the year. A great big bolt of joy.</p>
<p>Our collective heartache for Milan is huge and we want to take a moment to celebrate this incredible city with a selection of our best memories and most inspirational installations. This is a terrible blip that will pass and the passion of the design community will be bigger and brighter when we all meet again for the greatest design show on earth. For now, take heart and indulge in these gems that have given us so much.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Leading you indoors, a pathway to your front door, the first impression for your guests. A front garden can make a huge difference to your home.</p>
<p>Four years in the making, our front garden at the design house has been a bombsite for most of the time. The dumping ground for the build indoors, the skip wasteland, the pallet dropping-off point. We had so much work to do on the interior, we had not been ready to take on the path and planting that gives you your first taste of what awaits.</p>
<p>We are not gardeners, but we know a plant or two and we know what we love, so we applied some of our interior ideas to the makeover and got stuck in, with the beautifully re-instated victorian tiled path by Original Style as the main star.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We are cruise virgins and, as anyone who follows us will know, not very good at booking ourselves a holiday (we haven&#8217;t taken a proper holiday in about 5 years). We love what we do, design is our passion, so when we got the opportunity to combine cool new interiors, a London fashion week party, a stop in the bucket list destination of Portofino, with our first time on a cruise ship (albeit unfinished) &#8211; how could we not get rather excited and start packing some extremely impractical shoes?</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Here are our tips on how to create a more mindful kitchen to make you feel good and help you entertain friends in a relaxed style, using the new Studio Blue collection. ]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As we continue on our course of mindful living this year (time to look after ourselves as well as our work), we were asked by Denby Pottery, that well known family fav, to take a look at their new Studio Blue collection and see if we could style it for them. We have a small obsession with ceramics and blue is our go to favourite colour (when we aren&#8217;t going pink) so this was love at first sight for us. Each one is unique and the focus is on bowls, lots of them, big and small, in varying shades with a slight speckle on the surface. Delicious and so easy to love. Someone once told us (I think it was our lovely ceramic artist friend, William Martin) that blue and white ceramics are the most sought after al over the world – hardly surprising since it is such an effortlessly classic combo. We have also found out, from the lovely Denby team, that apparently we are increasingly picking up bowls to have a relaxed hearty dining experience. Have to say, we are with them on that. We love to make a huge bowl of something delicious to share with friends and family. Plates still have a place with us (on Sundays mainly for some bizarre reason – a big cooked breakfast would be a little odd in a bowl) but bowls are an everyday go to for a home cooked lunch in the studio for sure.</p>
<p>Here is our take on the Studio Blue collection for you to enjoy. Along with plenty of tips on creating a mindful kitchen in your own home.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When faced with a white box, limited time/cash and a landlord who is less than pleased about the prospect of you breaking open a pot of paint, how can you make your rental space feel like a real home. As interior designers we are often asked how our ideas can translate into a rented home and having rented for a large part of our adult lives we totally understand that interiors are really important, no matter how long you are staying in any given location. So we have put together some top tips to help you personalise your pad.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>You know we love flowers in our interiors here at 2LG Studio, so with Jordan&#8217;s birthday to celebrate last week we wanted to share with you our top tips on creating some impactful floral displays in your home, whatever you might be celebrating.</p>
<p>We teamed up with new UK brand, FlowerBe, to create some wow in our dining room ready for our friends to come over for lunch. This is definitely an all out look, but there are plenty of ideas you can take away and use in your own way, with your own favourite flowers.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">If you are in need of an inspirational injection of colour in your life, then look no further. David Hockney, master of colour, has been given a major exhibition at Tate Britain covering 60 years of his work and it is the must see, that everyone is talking about, for good reason. Sometimes you need to refill your creative pool and our trip to see the work of one of our heroes did just that.</span></p>
<p>His use of pinks and viridian greens and bold lush blues is food for our souls. These colours have been a major part of our work and seeing them used in this way gives us life. If you remember our Smash Hits project last year, the lines and colour blocking me palette were massively inspired by Hockney. The way he uses colour is just so unique.</p>
