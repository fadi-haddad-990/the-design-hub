		<description><![CDATA[Simple editions to our dressing room to help us create outfit of the day.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We love a high-low approach when it comes to design, often mixing high street with high end. It’s how people really design their homes, right? So when we were asked to explore the new Street Style Nomad trend by IKEA with its focus on functionality and adaptability, we were into it. Here in our dressing room we really wanted some kind of hanging solution for the middle of the room as we love to hang our outfits up the night before. This piece, with its relaxed impact and plenty of different hanging spaces was a cool solution. Want to see what else we found?</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Our lockdown labour of love, saving body and soul, as we create our dream garden space to entertain and enjoy the seasons. ]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Creating this new living space outdoors has been our lockdown labour of love. Combining our new found love affair with gardening and our longtime passion for interiors.</p>
<p>Good for the mind and body, our aching arms and legs are testament to this. The brand new wheelbarrow that now looks like it has seen 20 years of action with a keen gardener is also good reminder of the work that has gone into it and we have loved it all, come rain or shine because it has kept us active and there is something incredibly calming about the simple challenge of filling the wheel barrow and transporting things around the space. Not so much when it was loads of old bricks and broken concrete, more so with soil, but making a garden is swings and roundabouts. We can&#8217;t wait to enjoy it now and watch it evolve through the seasons.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It has taken us 5 years to design and renovate our design house and it was time to turn our attentions to the undiscovered space outside our back door. Making the outdoor space function as well as the indoor &#8211; and bringing our 2LG vibes to that outdoor space too of course.</p>
<p>There were many challenges (not least our lockdown locks). It was a beast that involved a lot of digging and planning. Many wheelbarrows of rubble and many hours of seed growing and planting.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Leading you indoors, a pathway to your front door, the first impression for your guests. A front garden can make a huge difference to your home.</p>
<p>Four years in the making, our front garden at the design house has been a bombsite for most of the time. The dumping ground for the build indoors, the skip wasteland, the pallet dropping-off point. We had so much work to do on the interior, we had not been ready to take on the path and planting that gives you your first taste of what awaits.</p>
<p>We are not gardeners, but we know a plant or two and we know what we love, so we applied some of our interior ideas to the makeover and got stuck in, with the beautifully re-instated victorian tiled path by Original Style as the main star.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>These are the permanent bits, the expensive bits, that you don&#8217;t want to have to change down the line, the hard surfaces and hardware that needs to be right first time. But that doesn&#8217;t mean you should be afraid and play it safe. It is still worth building up your courage and going for a well chosen bespoke finish or wow moment. It is all about balance.</p>
<p>So we are talking radiators, worktops and taps in this post. They will make your life in your home better, warmer, easier to clean (hopefully). So we wanted to give you an insight into our process when choosing these pieces for our kitchen project, to help you do the same in yours.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[How we achieved our pink tiled fireplace feature wall and what is next for our Kitchen renovation....all with a major Milanese influence. ]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Every now and then, when you are designing an interior scheme, (and this goes for you too in your own home) you come across a finish or an object or a colour and it grabs you with both arms and says &#8220;we were meant to be together&#8221;. You know when you just know. No question.</p>
<p>Well that happened for us with these tiles. We first specified them for a client project 2 years ago and it was love at first sight. Then we saw them making a huge impact at this years Milan Design Festival for an epic Hermes installation. And finally, by some strange twist of fate Mosaic Del Sur got in touch and asked if we would like to work with them. We told them about our kitchen plans and that was that.</p>
<p>It was less a case of finding a finish for a surface and more a case of finding a surface for the finish, because we were already smitten and knew that we had to make them part of our dream kitchen project. So that is the why and now we want to help you with the how.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There is such joy in painting outside the lines every once in a while. We love to push boundaries and try things that feel a little naughty. So curves have been high on the agenda for our kitchen design. Not a natural fit for the most functional of spaces but curves make us happy and show that you are prepared to think differently about the world &#8211; outside of the box.</p>
<p>Here we let you into our process and show you how we brought bold decorative curves into our space simply with paint and some nerve. We are also going to give you the first glimpse of the kitchen we have designed for the space. All about arches.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Tackling that dreaded junction between the original skirting boards and the new floor. We are not into angled trim all around the room and taking off the skirts to run the floors under them is a whole can of worms... So, we have our own solution for you. One that involves a minimum of fuss and a seamless result. ]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>AhhhhhhgGHHHGHHHggghhghhggghhHHHHH!</p>
<p>Fear not this is a good scream! A joyful scream that echoes around the now empty but pretty shell of the space we have now created.</p>
<p>The dust is finally on it&#8217;s way. The stress of wall coming out and sleeping in a house that is only held up by temporary acroprops is passed. The decision making has been done, and now we can enjoy putting it back together and beginning to make it look like a room rather than a builders playground.</p>
<p>Do you want to see what floors and doors we have chosen and how we have seamlessly bedded them into our setting? Read on if you are struggling with your own skirting details or feature wall vs all over colour choices or if your just love to see this space develop.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Our sitting room has been through so many transformations in our Design House project - here's how we got to the room that instagram went mad for. ]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A breathless glimpse at the many transformations of our sitting room over the past 2 years as our Design House Project has worked hard for us and not only been our muse but also our base. Netflix and chill has happened in this room as well as location shoots, but we are so happy with where it&#8217;s got to, even if it has been very dusty getting here and we have had to put up with endless people coming in and out. It&#8217;s always worth it in the end.</p>
<p>We rarely do &#8216;before and after&#8217; shots with our projects but this room was so loved on our social media and it really does have a lot of stories to tell. Here are just a few of them in photo diary form. Enjoy!</p>
