				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We love a high-low approach when it comes to design, often mixing high street with high end. Itâ€™s how people really design their homes, right? So when we were asked to explore the new Street Style Nomad trend by IKEA with its focus on functionality and adaptability, we were into it. Here in our dressing room we really wanted some kind of hanging solution for the middle of the room as we love to hang our outfits up the night before. This piece, with its relaxed impact and plenty of different hanging spaces was a cool solution. Want to see what else we found?</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Every April, for the past 6 years, we have been making an annual design pilgrimage to Milan for Salone Del Mobile, one of our favourite and most enriching weeks of the year. A great big bolt of joy.</p>
<p>Our collective heartache for Milan is huge and we want to take a moment to celebrate this incredible city with a selection of our best memories and most inspirational installations. This is a terrible blip that will pass and the passion of the design community will be bigger and brighter when we all meet again for the greatest design show on earth. For now, take heart and indulge in these gems that have given us so much.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Pride as important now as it has ever been and we wanted to show our pride with this Loveseat.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ercol, the iconic furniture brand, approached us to collaborate with them on a special limited edition of their classic loveseat. They are such an incredible brand, one that has been part of our homes and lives for as long as we can remember, and we love the strong family connections that still make the heart of the business.</p>
<p>We wanted to make this piece for Pride, as equality is so important to us, and so we took the base idea of the rainbow and gave it our own contemporary take, pastels and electric blue and neon yellow. Our inspiration was from the pride parade itself, as if the loveseat had been to the party and come back covered in the bold colours of pride itself. All of the colours blend together where they meet.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[A made to measure storage solution, delivered to your door, in a new colourful collection. ]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For a while now, we have wanted more storage in our bedroom. We had been sentimentally holding on to a vintage linen cupboard that has been with us for years but that is now in the guest bedroom as it was beautiful, but not so practical for everyday use. So when we were approached by <a href="https://tylko.com/?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=article&amp;utm_campaign=2lgstudio&amp;utm_content=01_2019"><strong>Tylko</strong></a> to check out their new Type 02 shelving in some of our signature colours, the timing couldn&#8217;t have been more perfect. It can be hard to find the right storage in a victorian property with odd shaped alcoves and this collection offers the flexibility of made to measure without any hassle. Just put in your measurements, pick a configuration that give you the maximum/best storage for your space and place the order to be delivered. Then you just have to watch Marie Kondo on repeat and get ready to put your most joyful things on display and in the drawers (everything visible of when you open it, of course) when it arrives.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Don't be afraid and play it safe. We are here to build up your courage and go for a well chosen bespoke finish or wow moment.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>These are the permanent bits, the expensive bits, that you don&#8217;t want to have to change down the line, the hard surfaces and hardware that needs to be right first time. But that doesn&#8217;t mean you should be afraid and play it safe. It is still worth building up your courage and going for a well chosen bespoke finish or wow moment. It is all about balance.</p>
<p>So we are talking radiators, worktops and taps in this post. They will make your life in your home better, warmer, easier to clean (hopefully). So we wanted to give you an insight into our process when choosing these pieces for our kitchen project, to help you do the same in yours.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[This is our expression of love in all its multi colours. Why choose just one colour to play with when you are given the opportunity to use several?]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Colour is about expression and joy. It can create emotion and fill a room with atmosphere. It can make you feel proud and energised and happy. We all experience colour in such diverse and unique ways so it becomes very personal. <a href="https://www.crownpaints.co.uk/paint-samples"><strong>Crown Paints</strong></a> approached us to show them how we interpret colour with paint and here is what happened, with some tips and paint effects to help you bring some flair into your own home with that most simple of changes, paint.</p>
<p>We always get excited when we get to play with colour. Colour has been an important part of our design business since we launched 5 years ago and, without even realising it, we became know for our signature use of colour. It is instinctive to us and it is often the starting point for any design project we take on. We love to meet a new client and start thinking about their personal colour palette.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[How we achieved our pink tiled fireplace feature wall and what is next for our Kitchen renovation....all with a major Milanese influence. ]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Every now and then, when you are designing an interior scheme, (and this goes for you too in your own home) you come across a finish or an object or a colour and it grabs you with both arms and says &#8220;we were meant to be together&#8221;. You know when you just know. No question.</p>
<p>Well that happened for us with these tiles. We first specified them for a client project 2 years ago and it was love at first sight. Then we saw them making a huge impact at this years Milan Design Festival for an epic Hermes installation. And finally, by some strange twist of fate Mosaic Del Sur got in touch and asked if we would like to work with them. We told them about our kitchen plans and that was that.</p>
<p>It was less a case of finding a finish for a surface and more a case of finding a surface for the finish, because we were already smitten and knew that we had to make them part of our dream kitchen project. So that is the why and now we want to help you with the how.</p>
