		<description><![CDATA[Take a moment to celebrate Milan Design week, the greatest design show on earth. This year we are all unable to be in Milan or share in the joy that they always give, so we look back at the best memories of past shows, with hope for the future. ]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Every April, for the past 6 years, we have been making an annual design pilgrimage to Milan for Salone Del Mobile, one of our favourite and most enriching weeks of the year. A great big bolt of joy.</p>
<p>Our collective heartache for Milan is huge and we want to take a moment to celebrate this incredible city with a selection of our best memories and most inspirational installations. This is a terrible blip that will pass and the passion of the design community will be bigger and brighter when we all meet again for the greatest design show on earth. For now, take heart and indulge in these gems that have given us so much.</p>

This lovely competition winning couple won a re-design of one room and we took it to the next level, giving them two new spaces, to set them up for a great start to their married life together. Designing their happy place for them was a joy.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Pride as important now as it has ever been and we wanted to show our pride with this Loveseat.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ercol, the iconic furniture brand, approached us to collaborate with them on a special limited edition of their classic loveseat. They are such an incredible brand, one that has been part of our homes and lives for as long as we can remember, and we love the strong family connections that still make the heart of the business.</p>
<p>We wanted to make this piece for Pride, as equality is so important to us, and so we took the base idea of the rainbow and gave it our own contemporary take, pastels and electric blue and neon yellow. Our inspiration was from the pride parade itself, as if the loveseat had been to the party and come back covered in the bold colours of pride itself. All of the colours blend together where they meet.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A visual love letter to the home of renowned architect and designer, Osvaldo Borsani. He was a visionary, yet unsung figure of italian twentieth-century design, combining artisanal knowledge with technical innovation.</p>
<p>Take a tour with us around one of the most stunning homes in italy, designed and built by Borsani bewteen 1939 and 1945, open to the public for the first time (curated by Ambra Medda). This &#8220;modernist jewel&#8221;, suspended in time, was certainly a highlight of our year so far.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[It is set to be an exciting year and it really needs to be. The world needs a revolution right now because we are in trouble.Here are our top ten installations that are not to be missed in Milan.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Here is our &#8216;top ten&#8217; of the installations that are not to be missed in Milan. Having gained the blisters and the awe-factor over the past 5 years, we will be updating you again this year with the latest trends in the design world direct from Milan as guests of Salone Del Mobile, but here are some of our top tip offs ahead of the show. Whether you are going and looking for the top things to see or if you can&#8217;t be there and are excited to see the latest, we have you covered.</p>
<p>Futurism began in Italy, the art and social movement launched by Marinetti in 1909 with his Futurist Manifesto, and so it is entirely appropriate that a new revolution is happening this year in Milan at the world&#8217;s largest design festival. Designers are going to be looking at &#8216;why&#8217; more intensely than the &#8216;what&#8217; this year as we try to make a better future. Sustainability and Veganism and Energy saving will all get attention, but against the backdrop (and standing on the shoulders of) Old Milan. The throughline of the most particular pink shades that feel so Milanese are tying the threads together this year more than ever. Deep blush pinks to terracottas have been news before but there is a new romance and affection to them this year. Saying, &#8220;yes, we want to look forward&#8221;, but we appreciate what we have and what has gone before.</p>
<p>Take a look at our top ten must sees and it will start to make more sense:</p>

		<description><![CDATA[A Sustainable and sexy garden pod designed by us with new materials, air purifying plants and a breakout snug for downtime. The ideal space to enjoy work life balance. ]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>With live/work spaces becoming increasingly important, we present our idea for a &#8216;Love/Work&#8217; space, imagined by us as a design studio in the garden of our South London home with minimalist vibes. Utilising cutting-edge sustainable materials to create a playful yet functional pod that is full of texture &#8211; Cork, recycled plastics, vegan leather made from waste pineapple leaf fibre, re-imagined vintage furniture and a minimal kitchen area for creative lunches. Bringing the outside in with a wall of plants to filter the air of the pod. A comfortable breakout snug for those much need moments of peace within a busy working day. Proving that sustainable can still be sexy.</p>
<p>We were invited to design this space as part of the show village, the main attraction at London Olympia&#8217;s &#8216;Ideal Home Show&#8217; 2018, by the wonderful Sophie Robinson, who we know from our time on BBC2&#8217;s Great Interior Design Challenge. Here is our inside track on how we designed the space and some of the amazing suppliers we worked with along the way.</p>

		<title>Renovation Haven &#8211; A project in phases</title>

		<description><![CDATA[Sometimes life happens in the middle of a project and a new approach is needed to get the family through the renovation. In this case, a new baby arrived early and so the focus was on making a bedroom/bathroom fit for the new arrival before the rest of project could continue. ]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When designing homes to be lived in, the life of the family taking on the renovation can sometimes take projects in unexpected directions and it is our job to help them through that. Living in a renovation project ourselves we know that have some part of the project finished to retreat to is incredibly important. This is a sneak peek of an unfinished project at a unique stage. This couple took on the complete renovation of a victorian house in North London before they knew they would be having a baby and so the clock was ticking (we didn&#8217;t even have time to iron the bedlinen &#8211; please forgive us) to make the space, or more specifically &#8216;a space&#8217;, habitable and comfortable for the new arrival.</p>
<p>This meant we decided with our couple to implement phases in the project. Creating a master suite of bedroom, walk -through wardrobe and ensuite, giving them a sanctuary of calm and cleanness as the rest of the project goes on hold for a moment while they find their feet as new parents.  We always try to be adaptable to these changes, especially when the baby arrives 3 weeks early, and cannot wait to get to the next phase &#8211; a loft conversion and ground floor kitchen extension with full re-design and re-decoration of the existing spaces. That can wait though, as for now you, and they, can enjoy the early phase of this project &#8211; Our client&#8217;s renovation haven.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Discover a new Wedgwood as we explore 'pottery porn' in the factory, 'interiors porn' in their new tearooms and revealing history in the museum...ooo and we threw a pot too...take a look!]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>British Icon, world class craftsmanship and now an amazing day out with luxury interior in the tea rooms and a museum, factory visit and the chance to have a go at getting your hands covered in the finest clay. If you think you know everything there is to know about Wedgewood?&#8230;Think again as we go behind the scenes.</p>
<p>Having been invited to take a tour of the new <strong><a href="https://www.worldofwedgwood.com/">World of Wedgwood</a></strong>, we had an amazing day out and left feeling so full of admiration, not only for the new team who have saved this classic design brand from the brink and given it new life, but also for the man himself, Josiah Wedgwood. We have such respect for his perspective on ethics and craft and equality. He was a new man in so many ways and he really paved the way for the modern way of life we know. What a national treasure and how wonderful that his legacy is now being given such a boost on the global stage.</p>
