		<description><![CDATA["Ultimately, the role of design should be to help enact and bring about social change towards a future that has a better chance at longevity. Longevity in terms of sustaining a habitable planet for us all, evening out social injustice and pulling back together a diverse society that is being viciously polarised."]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For several years, since graduating from 3D Product design at Northumbria Uni, we have been following the career of hot new designer, Mac Collins. After a hiatus on our design crush interview series, which has featured talents that we find exciting and inspiring, who better to re-launch a new series of interviews than this huge talent, who burst onto the design scene with his vibrant blue modern classic in the making, the Iklwa Chair. Now launched to market in a new colourway and with additional pieces to make a collection. Having collaborated with impressive Brit brand, Benchmark, it was the perfect time to get some insight into Mac&#8217;s creative process and the driving force behind his boundary pushing career path.</p>

		<description><![CDATA["The good thing about clay is that it forces you to have a direct contact with it; the pieces have your personal imprint and is one of the things that I am most passionate about the material." Cova Del Campo.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As part of our ongoing Desgin Crush series, we interviewed Cova Del Campo, founder of up and coming ceramic design studio, La Cueva. Based in Spain, Cova&#8217;s pieces caught our eye on instagram (as these things so often do) and we just had to know more about them as they are so fresh and clean. Flowers are a passion and these pieces elevate them to the next level, allowing an element of play in the way their strikingly simple shapes interact. Endlessly beautiful. Read on to find out more about the inspiration behind them and the process of going it alone to make your mark in the design world.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Clerkenwell Design Week is always a great place to meet new designer makers, find new products to specify for clients and make new friends in the design scene. This year is no different and it&#8217;s John Eadon who caught our eye with his bold retro modern designs. If arches do it for you and you are a geek for modular shelving or planters then John is your man &#8211; he has it all.</p>
<p>Get to know him, and his growing MIMA collection, a little better with our interview below. He also has some great advice for new designers.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Take a look inside one of the most inspiring contemporary interiors we've seen in a long time. Filled with clever use of bold colour and texture. ]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This interior stopped us in our tracks. Archways, curved upholstery, bold blue reveals on the doorways, pink rubber curtains, exposed concrete, an art wall to die for, killer lighting. It has it all.</p>
<p>So we wanted to share Club Unseen with you in all it&#8217;s glory, to give you some inspiration. The design duo, <a href="http://www.studiopepe.info/"><em>Studio Pepe</em></a> are ladies after our own hearts. They are smashing it and we are loving it. Sit back, pour yourself a coffee and let the photos do the talking.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Meet the stylish modern gent behind brit brand, Novocastrian, and one half of design Studio, Lind+Almond - bringing a new refinement to artisanal industrial design. ]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Having been fellow Forest Hill dwellers and friends now for around 3 years, we wanted to take some time to share the work of a great northern bloke, Richy Almond, the man behind Novocastrian and one half of design studio, Lind+Almond.</p>
<p>Their newly launched interior for Hotel Sanders in Copenhagen is an artisan dream that relies on nothing but quality craftsmanship and you can now buy the furniture pieces designed for the Hotel direct from them. They also have a new range from Novocastrian, using their signature patinated brass and rare british marble. Look out for some of his furniture in one of our new interior projects coming out later this year.</p>
<p>We love Richy&#8217;s refined take on metalwork, a new industrial look that is full of inspiration, with raw materials as the star of his work. He is also a great beer drinker and a real charmer. We hope you will love him as much as we do.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Get to know the quiet man behind one of the most iconic designs of the past decade...and he has done it again. ]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This is an interview with a lovely man we met in Milan 3 years ago and now he is showing his latest game-changing designs there. We say &#8216;game-changing&#8217; with trepidation, but there is no denying he is responsible for one of the most iconic designs of the last decade (the Plumen bulb) and this new led lighting collection for Beem, including one called &#8216;Smile&#8217; (don&#8217;t mind if we do) is set to be another winner.</p>
<p>This guy isn&#8217;t loud or showy. He is just bloody good. Perhaps the next Jasper Morrison in the making? Have a read and decide for yourself. You may be surprised by how many of his designs you recognise.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Simplicity, pop and pencil sketches. Richard Yasmine caught our eyes with his decorative yet minimal designs. He has a freshness to his designs and an ease in his process that makes us very happy. His designs are also a perfect mix of pop-futurism in delicious pastel shades and we can&#8217;t get enough.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Standout lighting leading the way in the new re-launch of one of our favourite design brands, Established and Sons. ]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So here it is. The new collection from Established &amp; Sons under the creative vision of Sebastian Wrong, who has assembled an incredible team of designers, young and old, for his first presentation. The collection has a distinctly european flavour, but with names like &#8216;Barbican&#8217; for its playful new sofa, and a shoreditch preview launch ahead of it&#8217;s Milan debut, the roots are still firmly in London.</p>
<p>Having interviewed the master of pop design, Sebastian Wrong, last year in Milan we were so excited to follow through on that and share this with you. It may be a quieter collection than some might have expected, but it is a grower and the quality of the fabrics and processes on show doesn&#8217;t disappoint. The lighting is particularly delicious and all of the pieces are clearly designed for life, with bold graphic illustrations giving a playful nod to how you might live with the pieces.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[A lightbulb moment with the lovely, Tim Rundle a stunning pop up apartment by Menu in the heart of East London. Meet the lovely designer behind scandi brand, Menu's, new lighting launch.  ]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>At the launch of the new Lightbulb/Light-fitting hybrid that is going to change the way you live (especially if you are renting or have that bare flex hanging aimlessly waiting for a fitting but you never get round to booking that electrician) we got talking to the designer, Tim Rundle. Not only was the apartment the most stunning example of scandi urban luxury, kitted out in all the latest and most beautiful pieces from Menu (a design brand you need to know about because they are coming into their own right about now) but we were also struck with what a lovely and generous man Tim was. He has designed a light bulb that can screw into a standard bulb fitting and is a light fitting in its own right. A very beautiful one at that. A simple orb of diffused light that would make any room better.</p>
<p>Here is our quickfire interview with Tim, giving you insider info on his process and why he thinks we are always learning. We couldn&#8217;t agree more.</p>
