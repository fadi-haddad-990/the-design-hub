		<description><![CDATA["An evolving interior, a place to spread our wings, our muse, our studio, our canvas, our home” Jordan and Russell]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Each element has been inspired by found objects and prints from within the house as well as our own design travels. Its previous owners clearly had a passion for interiors as it had pink walls throughout, and deep green carpets. In the loft we found a stash of old interior magazines from the 50&#8217;s and 60&#8217;s as well as remnants of fabrics.</p>
<p>The garden, with its central apple tree, old english roses and camelia tree, also has a major impact on the way we are designing the spaces. Inspiring the colour palette and floral motifs.</p>
<p>As the house evolves with us, it has been through many stages, acting not only as a home, but as a backdrop for our work as designers. So far we have restored the roof and chimneys, the original sash windows and floors. We have completed the pink bathroom, updated the front door, given ourselves a wonder closet for a WC, created an entrance hallway the previous owners would have loved, we hope, and given the lounge added panelling to go with the original coving and ceiling rose, based on pencil markings we found on the walls under the old wallpaper. The open plan kitchen/diner/studio space is the heart of the project and was the inspiration behind many new product designs.</p>
<p>As seen in Dezeen, Sunday Times Home, Living Etc and Harpers Bazaar.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[The biggest challenge, as is always the case with our interior design work, was staying true to the strong architectural roots of the space, whilst allowing the clients personalities to shine.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The brief for this space, within pop-up design experience called DreamHouzz, was challenging but so much fun. A creative professional couple working in east London who love to travel. Design is important to them and they have a spare room for dressing so this space is their sanctuary. They love animals and have a mini dachshund who shares their bed with them. They lead busy lives and wanted a vibrant bedroom to set them up for their day. They love to read with a drink to relax, away from their phones or TV. This is a non tech zone.</p>
<p>The Wallpaper is a witty nod to their beloved animal companion. Touching on the line drawing trend that is having a big moment. The arches of the bed nod to their love of European design and adds a soft line to the industrial setting of their home. The space showcases modernist aspects of design and has vibrant colour to match the energy and open mindedness of the clients. The Wallpaper adds a witty edge to show that the couple don’t take themselves too seriously</p>
<p>The space is quite long but we zoned it to make a bold statement of the bed by the window and give space for a breakout chill space, for reading with a nightcap before bed. The biggest challenge, as always in our work as interior designers, was staying true to the strong architectural roots of the space, whilst allowing the clients personalities to shine. The organic curves of the sofa perfectly balance the hard industrial elements of the setting. It’s large size gives a luxurious hotel feel to the space. Perfect for relaxing before bed with your partner or on a Sunday morning with a flat white.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[We wanted to take Oka luxury and shake it up with an urban setting. Why shouldn't industrial loft spaces feel layered and luxe? ]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>West coast vibes meet King&#8217;s Road casual chic in a luxury loft apartment (in Hackney). That&#8217;s where we decided to go with this one when Oka Home approached us to style this space (a set designed by us) with their new collection.</p>
<p>We wanted to take Oka luxury and shake it up with an urban setting. Why shouldn&#8217;t industrial loft spaces feel layered and luxe?</p>
<p>It was a fun brief and we had fun with it by adding our signature stripes, a motif we have used in many of our projects and one that we can&#8217;t resist coming back to as it is so classic and versatile.</p>
<p>The fine-framed black crittal window gives the space epic light and grounds the more playful colours. We particularly love the oversized Malachite lamps, symmetrically framing the ornate coloured glass mirror.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Working with this legendary design brand was epic. Family run, with international reach, they really allowed us to stretch our wings and made us feel so supported as young designers. ]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We were invited to &#8216;Re-imagine&#8217; the Ligne Roset london showroom and we immediately thought of using print design to give the showroom an uncharacteristic decorative twist, bringing our unique interior aesthetic to this modern design brand. The re-launched Slice chair by Pierre Charpin was the perfect piece to show our fractured floral designs.</p>
<p>The success of this installation led us to New York where we were asked to give our unique treatment to the Soho showroom. Our fading, fragmented florals were used on pillars and a 5m long wall in the showroom, giving major decorative impact and creating a backdrop for upholstered pieces in our printed linen. Projection was used to flood the huge warehouse space with our floral motifs. The Forest Hill collection of wallpapers and fabrics is <a href="http://www.custhom.co.uk/shop/product-category/forest-hill/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">available now to order here</a></p>

		<description><![CDATA[LDF is one of our favourite weeks in the design calendar each year and what a thrill it was to be right at the heart of it, delivering our visual concept for these spaces and giving interior design advice in our 'sold out' Design Clinics. ]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We wanted to create a playful vibe for this Nest.co.uk installation at Design Junction. The mint green colour palette was an early decision as well as the bespoke terrazzo surface and terrazzo printed vinyls, bags and uniforms (all part of our scheme), giving a coherent impact with a fresh twist on a retro material that has since made a major comeback.</p>
<p>To display small product in the shop we used colourful chip foam blocks to compliment the terrazzo used elsewhere and show our fun side. Colouring-in was encouraged in our VIP shopping lounge and the results by members of the public papered the walls throughout, giving a colourful display of collective creativity by the end of the week long show.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Performing many functions for family life, the kitchen table transforms from office desk, to children&#8217;s playtime, to artists studio to bakers work station to entertaining space &#8211; and that can be just in one day for so many modern homes.</p>
<p>Setting out to make this hardworking space both functional and beautiful we were inspired by the new arts and crafts movement. Our modern concept has added decorative flair. With natural materials leading the pared back design, the star being the finely crafted bare wood furniture, and giving it this muted colour palette of pinks and greens. Decorative joy, one of our signatures, comes from the hand printed wallpaper based on fragmented floral motifs from our new Forest hill Collection, of papers and textiles, designed and made in collaboration with award winning studio, Custhom. With panelling on the walls to give an elegant base, dedicated storage for various tasks and plants for added homeliness. Beauty and function combine in a nature inspired living/dining experience that transforms for your needs.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Styling this shoot in our own location house was pure pleasure as we love all things winter. The giant fir tree came from our overgrown garden and made this a very special memory.
]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We were hired to showcase luxury brands in this winter styling shoot, located in our design house. The large rooms lent themselves to a grand theme with a subtle winter touch in the foliage and colour palettes.</p>
<p>The carpets by Brintons (in collaboration with Timorous Beasties) create a feeling of luxury, with bold pattern choices in stark contrast with the bare plaster walls and old peeling wallaper.</p>
<p>The stunning hand-glazed tiles and deep blue limewash paint from Bert &amp; May give the bedroom/bathroom a geometric lift with a bloomsbury group edge.</p>
<p>The interstellar art works, paired with the Zuzanaga pixelated fabric panel at the window, give a futuristic vibe in the starkly stripped bedroom. All art works came from Art.com. Accessories and lighting were our own.</p>
